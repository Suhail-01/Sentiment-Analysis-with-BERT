# ðŸ“Š Sentiment Analysis with BERT

This project demonstrates how to perform sentiment analysis using the BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model. BERT is a state-of-the-art NLP model developed by Google that has achieved remarkable results on a variety of natural language understanding tasks.

## ðŸš€ Project Overview

In this project, we fine-tune a pre-trained BERT model for sentiment classification. The model is trained on a dataset containing text and corresponding sentiment labels (e.g., positive or negative). After training, the model can predict the sentiment of new text inputs.
